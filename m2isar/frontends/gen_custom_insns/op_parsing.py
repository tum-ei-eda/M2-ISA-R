"""
Templates for Operations modeled with the M2-ISA-R metamodel.
New instructions are added by updating the dict 'OP_TEMPLATES'
In this dict instructions keywords are mapped to a function,
	that has an argument 'operands' of type Dict[str, behav.IndexedReference]'
They need to return any subclass of behav.Basenode, but not behav.assignment
	as they get put into an assignmenat after key lookup (load/store inst is not possible right now)
The reasoning behind it, is that this way they can be chained to create new instructions
