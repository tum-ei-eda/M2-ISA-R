"""This module contains the M2-ISA-R metamodel classes to build an ISA from. The M2-ISA-R
metamodel is split into two submodules, one for architectural description, one for the behavioral
description.

Also included are preprocessing functions, mostly to simplify a model and to extract information
about scalar and function staticness as well as exceptions.

Any model traversal should use the :func:`patch_model` function and a module including the needed
transformations. :func:`patch_model` monkey patches transformation functions into the classes of the
behavior model, therefore separating model code from transformation code. For examples on how
these transformation functions look like, see either the modules in :mod:`m2isar.metamodel.utils`
or the main code generation module :mod:`m2isar.backends.etiss.instruction_transform`. For a description
of the monkey patching, see :func:`patch_model`.

Usually a M2-ISA-R behavioral model is traversed from top to bottom. Necessary contextual
information is passed to lower levels by a user-defined `context` object. Each object should then
generate a piece of output (e.g. c-code for ETISS) and return it to its parent. Value passing between
generation functions is completely user-defined, :mod:`m2isar.backends.etiss.instruction_transform`
uses complex objects in lower levels of translation and switches to strings for the two highest levels of
the hierarchy.
